Let us take the example of a simple movie library. Each movie has a description, director, and serial number. Customers have a name, address, and membership number. Assume only one copy of each movie exists in the library. We are given the following relations and determinants. The keys for each relation are CAPITALIZED.

Relations (The key is CAPITALIZED):
customer(name,addr,MEMBERNO)
movie(DESCRIPTION,director,serialno)
borrow(memberno,DATE,SERIALNO)
Which of these determinants is a NON-KEY dependency? In the text box, only enter the index number (1-6) of the dependency which you have identified as non-key.

1.  description->director,serialno
2.  serialno->description
3.  serialno->director
4.  name,addr -> memberno
5.  memberno -> name,addr
6.  serialno,date -> memberno
