Let us take the example of a simple movie library. Each movie has a description, director, and serial number. Customers have a name, address, and membership number. Assume only one copy of each movie exists in the library. We are given the following relations and determinants. The keys for each relation are CAPITALIZED.

Relations (The key is CAPITALIZED):
customer(name,addr,MEMBERNO)
movie(DESCRIPTION,director,serialno)
borrow(memberno,DATE,SERIALNO)

Determinants:
description->director,serialno
serialno->description
serialno->director
name,addr -> memberno
memberno -> name,addr
serialno,date -> memberno
The above relation is in x**NF form where x may take the following values {1,2,3,3.5} corresponding to {1NF, 2NF, 3NF and BCNF} respectively.
What is the maximum possible value of **x such that the above relation satisfies the *x*NF form?
Your answer should only be restricted to one of these numbers:1/2/3/3.5 Do not leave any leading or trailing spaces.
